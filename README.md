# MLC — MinecraftLauncherCLI

**English** | [简体中文](README.zh-CN.md)

A cross-platform Minecraft launcher written in C++20 / Qt 6, centered on the lightweight command-line frontend `mlc` (RSS ~4MB) — suitable for desktops, servers, and headless environments.

## Features

- **CLI first**: modpack import, instance management, version download, and game launch all work in a terminal; interactive pickers and wizards on TTY (create-vite style)
- **Modpack import**: CurseForge / Modrinth / MultiMC / HMCL / PCL launcher packs / compressed `.minecraft` / plain mod packs; automatic download of game files, modloaders (Forge / NeoForge / Fabric), and mods
- **Isolated instances**: each instance gets its own directory; `.incomplete` marker + full rollback on failure — no half-installed instances
- **Vanilla download**: install any MC version with one command (latest release by default); re-running verifies and repairs
- **Java management**: detects system Java, picks per MC version compatibility matrix, auto-downloads JRE from Adoptium when missing
- **Player profiles**: multiple offline player profiles (name / avatar / skin type) with interactive add/edit/remove/select; authlib-injector external login (e.g. LittleSkin) with encrypted, persisted sessions auto-refreshed online at launch
- **Launch stability**: automatic memory sizing (50% of available RAM, capped at 16G), GC tiers, auto-fix for fcitx/ibus XIM crashes (GLFW 3.4 replacement), full launch logs on disk
- **Local server hosting**: install and run vanilla/Forge/Fabric/NeoForge servers with two commands (`server-install`/`server-start`), console attached, headless-friendly
- **QML GUI** (test version): shares the same SDK (libmlccore) with the CLI

## Install

### One-liner (recommended)

Official prebuilt package (embedded CurseForge key — the full experience), for x86_64 (amd64) and macOS (Apple Silicon). Linux aarch64 users: build from source below (Qt has no official 6.11 Linux ARM64 packages, so no prebuilt for now):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/recallrw80-afk/MLC/releases/latest/download/install.sh | bash
```

In China, the source falls back automatically — GitHub first, Gitee mirror on failure; no flags needed (add `--beta` for pre-releases).

> The Gitee mirror ships prebuilt binaries only (no source archives, no source builds). To build from source, clone from GitHub: `git clone https://github.com/recallrw80-afk/MLC.git`

To install the latest **pre-release** (Beta): `latest` never points at pre-releases, so fetch install.sh from the tag URL and pass `--beta`:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/recallrw80-afk/MLC/releases/download/v0.1.3-beta/install.sh | bash -s -- --beta
```

(Replace `v0.1.3-beta` with the latest pre-release tag.)

Or grab the tarball from [Releases](https://github.com/recallrw80-afk/MLC/releases/latest), put it next to `install.sh`, and run `bash install.sh mlc-linux-<arch>.tar.xz`.

### Build from source

For hacking/custom builds. Note: locally built packages do not embed a CF key (CurseForge falls back to the MCIM mirror); use the official package for the full experience.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/recallrw80-afk/MLC.git
cd MLC
make install        # build Release → zero-dependency package → install to ~/.local
```

Requirements: Qt 6.11+ (Core/Network), CMake 3.16+, Ninja, a C++20 compiler, nlohmann-json 3.11+, ZLIB. Qt prefix defaults to `$HOME/Qt/6.11.1/gcc_64`; override with `make install QT_PREFIX=/path/to/Qt/6.x/gcc_64`.

To install a package built on another machine: `bash cli/install.sh mlc-linux-<arch>.tar.xz`.

### Update & uninstall

```bash
mlc update         # check GitHub Releases and update in place (install.sh-installed copies only)
mlc uninstall      # uninstall (clears the game folder)
mlc uninstall -r   # uninstall but keep game folder contents
```

### Common build targets

```bash
make cli            # build mlc + libmlccore.so (Debug)
make package-tar    # zero-dependency tarball at cli/dist/mlc-linux-<arch>.tar.xz
make run            # build & launch the QML GUI (test version, binary name mlc-gui)
```

## Quick start

```bash
# Import a modpack (game folder defaults to ./mc/ next to the binary; change with set-folder)
mlc inpack ~/Downloads/some-modpack.zip

# List instances and pick one interactively to launch
mlc launch

# Or play vanilla
mlc mc-install        # latest release
mlc launch 1.20.1
```

See [cli/README.md](cli/README.md) for the full command reference. Every command accepts `-h` for detailed parameter help (e.g. `mlc inpack -h`); `mlc help` lists all commands.
